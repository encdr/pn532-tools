## code snippets for the PN532 module using Adafruit's library

new release & documentation coming soon.<br>
<br>
<ins>current features are: </ins> <br>
• reading an NTAG215/216/217<br>
• emulate a blank ISO1443A MIFare tag<br>
<br>
tested on an Arduino UNO R3, altough it should work with many more,<br> just make sure that it has the right CPU & enough flashmemory.<br>  
To access a menu for debugging, you must use a serial monitor application.<br> I recommended "CoolTerm" by Roger Meier.
